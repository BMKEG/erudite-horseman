# erudite-horseman
Building scraping tools to aggregate metadata about data science courses using the node horseman library

This is executed currently as a standalone script using the `./headlessHorseman.sh` script that permits these components to be incorporated into other pipelines. 

This project was built on top Andrew Forth's command line interface for horseman (https://github.com/anderfjord/node-phantom-cli).
